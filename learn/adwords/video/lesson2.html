          <h2 class="text-center">Transcript: How To Add Keywords To Your AdWords Campaign</h2>
      <p class="p-transcr">
We’ll be using LearnZilla.com as our AdWords example. For this, we’ll need to create a Search campaign that will help us target users that are interested in learning adwords.
We’ll name our first campaign after our product - AdWords. You can go ahead and click on the Pen that hovers above Campaign name, and change that to AdWords.
<br><br>
Within it, we are going to create a set of Ad Groups. Ad groups are essentially sub-campaigns that use all the same settings and budget but enable you to give them each their own keywords, ads, bids, and more. These Ad Groups should all fall under the same theme, a product, or a product category to help you organize your campaigns, but more on this later.
<br><br>
When we go to the settings tab, we can see all the settings we have set when created this campaign in our first lesson. Here you can see the Target Locations, language we are targeting, and the budget.
<br><br> For now, we just need to change our campaign type, as we will learn Google Search network at first, and later on we will tackle Display campaigns. Let’s go ahead set this to Search only – All Features by clicking Edit and selecting Search Only from the drop-down. This will allow us to have as much control over our search campaigns as possible. After all, you’ll be an expert in AdWords in no time.

Great! Let’s get back to creating our ad groups by going to the Ad Groups tab.
<br><br>
We will use our first ad group to target Google users that would like to learn adwords and another ad group to target users that want to practice for their AdWords certification exam. So we’ll use the same campaign settings for them, but the keywords and ads will be specific to each type of user.
<br><br>
          
Let’s name these two and add the keywords to them together. Click on the pen to edit the name of our first ad group, and since this ad group will target users looking to Learn Adwords – we’ll just name it Learn. 
-	To create a second ad group, you can either go through the ad group creation process using this red button or copy and paste the existing ad group, which is a bit easier for me. Simply click the check box next to the ad groups you’d like to copy, click Edit, then copy and paste. Just be sure to change the keywords and ads in the new ad group if you do this, otherwise they’re all identical to the ad group we copied them from. Let’s name this ad group Practice Exam.
          <br><br>
Awesome! For this ad group, let’s create ads that are better suited for to visitors who want to practice for the certification exam. To do this, just go to the Ads tab and change the title of our ads. Click on the little pen that appears when you hover over the ad, press Edit – “Study For AdWords Exams”. Also feel free to change all of the descriptions as needed. I’m going to leave mine as they are for now, as they still seem to be relevant. Hit save. We don’t need a second ad for now, we’ll pause this.
<br>
Now we get to the fun part – adding keywords.

<br><br>
Let’s add a few keywords to our first ad group – the Learn ad group. Let’s head over to the keywords tab and hit the red + Keywords button, and select our Learn ad group. Here’s a pro tip: One word keywords like “adwords” are often considered too broad, they bring too much “general interest” and may not necessarily bring in clients that are interested in your product. This traffic often quickly leaves the site and may not be the best investment. These are called short-tail keywords, longer keywords are called long-tail keywords. There is much more search volume for short-tail keywords such as “adwords”, however not all of these searches are looking to learn about adwords. Maybe they’re searching for adwords news or for adwords customer service, so we wouldn’t want to bring them to our site. Long-tail keywords often bring more specific clientele. For example, let’s look at the keyword “where to learn adwords online”. These users are much more likely to be looking for a specific site to learn adwords, and are not just doing research on Adwords or looking for news. This long-tail keyword is much more effective at bringing interested visitors to our website, instead of those who will just hit the Back button.
“where can I learn adwords online for free?” is another great example. I usually try to avoid single-word keywords and stick with two word keywords or more. 
There are 4 different types of keywords we can use in AdWords, they are called Match Types. And don’t be intimidated, these are ultimately going to help you target the EXACT searches you want to go after.
          <br><br>
First one is called broad match. If we go with just one keyword for now – “adwords”  and it’s broad match keyword, it will also show our ads for general search queries such as “adwords news, learn about adwords sitelinks, and what is adwords cost”. This match type is very general, it certainly brings in lots of traffic, but it may not necessarily give you the best return on your investment, but that’s where the other three come in. 
          <br><br>
Second match type is modified broad match. This means that the search queries must include keywords that have a plus sign in front of them.  Ex. +learn +adwords +online. This will show search queries that include all 3 of these keywords, and potentially some others. For example “where to learn adwords online”. This keyword has all 3 of our keywords, and therefore meets the criteria. AdWords will ignore the order of these keywords in modified broad match.
          
<br><br> However, order is particularly important in Phrase match. This is the third match type. Phrase match means that the query has to show a set of keywords or a “phrase” in it, and the order of these keywords matters.  For example “learn adwords online” has to appear in that exact sequence, and potentially with other keywords. This match type uses double quotation marks. Some of the keywords that your ads would show for are “where to learn adwords online” or “learn adwords online for free”. These all have the 3 keywords appear in that particular sequence.<br><br>
Finally we have exact match. This is as specific as you can get. Google will only show the exact search query without any other keywords, and only in their specific order. It uses the square brackets: [adwords… courses]. This will not show up for “free adwords courses” as it is limited to exactly the two keywords we used and in that particular order. While this will get you quality clicks, don’t limit your ad groups to just exact match keywords, as this will limit the number of users who see your ads, and may hinder how many clicks you can get in a day.
          <br><br>
	Ok, let’s sum up our match types: 
Broad match can show up for a whole variety of keywords containing our words in them. Modified broad match can show any keywords containing our words in them in any order… Phrase Match can show any keywords containing the phrase that we included, in that specific order, and exact match is as specific as you can get. No other keywords will be allowed and no other order followed.
	<br><br>
It’s general practice to add all 4 match types of each keyword into an ad group in the beginning, and then weed out the keywords that don’t work by either pausing them, or lowering their bids. 
<br><br>	Are you bored yet? Alright, let’s actually add some keywords.
You can put these match types in yourself, but why bother if you can use the keyword toaster tool online. Let’s go to  keywordstoaster.worldofsolomon.com/, which is fun and simple: Copy your broad match keywords and paste them on the left of this neat tool: "learn adwords Adwords courses, learn adwords online” and you get all 3 other match types on the right. Neato! Copy and paste all of these into your ad group, and hit save!
	
Voila, we’re all done!
          <br><br>
Right about now, you may be having second thoughts about the keywords we added initially, and you’d be right, those may not be such a great match because they are so general. Let’s take a look:
Open university courses, courses online, online classes, marketing courses, are all pretty broad terms and are going to result in our ads showing to those looking for an online university to learn all sorts of stuff outside of adwords. We wouldn’t want to pay for any of those clicks because it’s much more likely that the traffic won’t find what they’re looking for on our site and bounce right out. So it’s a pretty good idea to pause all of the keywords that don’t include adwords. I’m going to select the first keyword in here, hold Shift, and select the last of the first bunch that I want to pause, then select the rest. Adwords broad match might be a little too broad, and this will do. Let’s hit Edit, then hit Pause for all of these. Wonderful, this ad group should be ready to go. 
          <br><br>
Because we copied the practice exams ad group, it is actually going to have  these same keywords in there, which we don’t want. Let’s Head over there, and pause all of these initial keywords, and add a few new ones that are going to drive the traffic that we want. Go ahead and hit the red Add Keywords button.
Since we are looking to bring in traffic that’s looking for Google AdWords Certification exam practice questions, let’s go back into the keyword toaster tool and add some of these keywords as well as all of their match types. Let’s add “practice for adwords certification exam”, “adwords certification exam course” and “adwords certification practice” should do for now. Copy these over using CTRL + C, and use CTRL (or command if you’re using a mac) + V to paste them into our Keywords tab.
<br><br>
          At this point you’re probably wondering about the dollar amounts and the Max CPC labels that you see in our Keywords tab.
This is how keywords work. Each keyword can have its own bid, which is the Max CPC Column, and they all go into a “keyword auction” when the keyword is triggered from a relevant search query. The highest bid and most relevant keyword will win the auction, and in turn will show on google using the most relevant ad. The higher the keyword bid, the more it will show as opposed to others, up until you’re out of budget. Oftentimes, keywords may not run at all, if the bids are too low or if there is low search volume for that specific keyword, but AdWords can actually help us here with a handy column called Estimated. First Position bid (or Est First Page) bid. 
<br><br>
This column will show you an approximate bid amount that will get your ad to be the first ad on the first page. Just go to the Columns drop-down on top of the Keywords tab, click Modify Columns… and you can find the Estimated First Position bid column within the Attributes tab. Feel free to add any other columns you may find useful. These look good so far to me, so I’ll hit Apply.
The First Position bid data will usually show up after the keyword has received several impressions. 
Some of my favorite metrics are bounce rates and time spent on site, these can be added too, but we’ll need to link our Google Analytics to our AdWords account to see them, and in our bonus lesson, we’ll do just that.
	
	<br><br>
To sum up bids, the higher the bid, the more clicks and views (also called impressions)  a keyword will get. You will only be charged when someone clicks on your ad, but keep in mind that a higher bid may mean a higher cost for a keyword, so keep an eye on the Cost Per Click column – called Average CPC. More expensive keywords don’t always mean that you’re getting the most value.
	<br><br>
Next time around, we’re going to link up our Google Analytics to our AdWords account in a bonus mini lesson, and after that we will discuss ads, ad rotation, and getting the most out of each keyword.
