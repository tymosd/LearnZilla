      <p class="p-transcr">
Welcome back to LearnZilla’s introductory AdWords course and congratulations! You are well on your way to becoming an adwords expert. You are just a few lessons away from becoming a paid search guru.
Today we’ll be making more ads to go with our keywords and later on, we’ll be adding several negative keywords to make sure we only get the best clicks.
<br><br>So, there are 3 basic guidelines to creating ads:
<br><br>1st is: Google only allows you to use 1 exclamation point (and it has to be in the description); 
<br>2nd is You cannot say Click Here. Google considers those ads “spammy” and will not approve them for use.
<br>Finally, be sure to Capitalize the first letter of Each word and be sure to utilize 100% of your ad space. These two tips will make your ads look bigger and ensure that they stand out from your competition.
<br><br>When making your ads, make them as relevant as possible by using your keywords. Whenever your ad appears, matching words from the search query will be highlighted in your ad. This will make your ad different from others, so make sure you throw in a few of your keywords into the ad itself.


<br><br>Ok, enough about the policies for one day, let’s head over to our Learn Ad Group, and jump to the Ads tab.
You can copy and create ads just as you can with ad groups. You can create a whole new ad, or just use the Copy and Edit button in the top-right corner of the ad. This makes the ad creation process super simple, and you don’t have to start from scratch.
	
<br><br>Let’s start by modifying our initial ad by going to Copy and Edit. In this ad, I would like to change the title to something more suitable for the Learn ad group. Let’s try a title “Free AdWords Tutorial”, ok… and a description of “Learn AdWords Online”. Very good. I actually like our current description, but I would like to add a more descriptive Display URL. 
<br>	
This is simply the URL that is displayed under your ad, and not the actual destination where the user will be directed when they click on the ad... Final URL is right here on top, and is the actual landing page of this ad. Display URL should summarize what the page is about and be relevant to the ad group. In our case, we can call it Adwords. And guess what? When a keyword has a word “adwords” in it, that word will be bolded in our Display URL, which will make our ad stand out! Great, let’s Save this and move on.

<br><br>Well, that was easy! but I’m not sure if the word “courses” will resonate with our potential visitors, so I’m going to make one more ad for good measure. 
Let’s copy and edit on our last ad, and try adding the word “online” into our title, maybe this will perform better. “Free Online AdWords Tutorials" I like that. 
Why not try something new with the 2nd headline, too! “Hands-on Video Lessons”. 
<br><br> Yes, I’m not the best ad writer that ever lived, but you don’t have to be to succeed in adwords! It’s simply a matter of trial and error… As marketers, we only have somewhat of an idea of what might resonate with our demographic, no one is ever fully sure, so it never hurts to try a few different ads, and sooner or later, we’ll find the winners.
Let’s create a new description before we move on.
<br><br>“Free Online Video Courses And Quizzes For Future AdWords Experts. Learn More!”
<br><br>When you create several ads like we did, you can see which ads work best for you, and which ones don’t. Click-through-rate is a great metric for determining which of your ads works best. This metric is calculated by taking Clicks and dividing them by Impressions. In other words, how many users clicked on the ad, out of how many saw it. The higher the percentage, the better the ad. 


<br><br>I want to emphasize that it’s important to make sure your title as relevant as possible. According to studies, users don’t always read the description.  So make the headlines engaging, and tell the audience why your product/company is best. 
	
Finally, I would like to point out one very important point about editing and removing ads and keywords.
<br><br>Whenever you edit, or remove an ad, its historical data will become harder to find and impossible to see in reports as it will be considered a “removed ad”. Most agencies and companies copy the ads before editing them, and just pause old ads… never remove. This ensures that you have data from your past and your reports show accurate information. AdWords will actually warn you about this when you try to Edit an ad, saying your old ad’s statistics will be visible in the Totals below, but what they’re not telling you is that those statistics won’t show up on your reports as part of the total. Same applies for ad groups, campaigns, and anything else you may create or remove in adwords.
Great job on creating your ads! In the last few minutes of this lesson, I would like to briefly introduce you to Negative Keywords.

<br><br>Negative keywords are an amazing tool. They work just like regular keywords, but they do the opposite. Including a negative keyword means that your ads will never show for a search query featuring that specific keyword. We can have negative keywords for the whole campaign, or for a single ad group, depending on where you implement them. 
          
<br><br>Let’s look at an example. Our Learn ad group features broad match keywords such as “learn google adwords online”. In a broad match situation like this, Google may or may not show our ads for similar queries such as “learn google analytics online”.  We wouldn’t want to spend money on this click if we don’t offer any Analytics courses, as they’re likely to just leave the site soon after coming in.

<br><br>To prevent our ads from showing for this keyword, let’s add “analytics” to our negative keywords list by going back to our keywords tab…. And the Negative Keywords sub-menu. Press the Add Keywords button under the Campaign Level, then simply type “analytics” in here and press Save.
<br><br>
Be wary of other ad groups when implementing your negative keywords at the Campaign level. Make sure there is no conflict with some of the keywords in other ad groups. Always check back when implementing new negative keywords, Google will tell you if there is a conflict, but for some reason, it doesn’t say anything right away. In our case, there will be another campaign for Google Analytics courses, so we can safely add the “analytics” negative keyword to this Campaign. 
          
<br><br>You can also add negative keywords to an ad group by going into an ad group, and then going to the negative keywords sub-tab.
-	Let’s add a few other keywords that I think may negatively affect our campaign. Keywords such as “news” and “cost” would likely appear in popular queries from those looking to find out more about the cost of adwords, or adwords news. These queries are probably not coming from those that want to learn how to use adwords, so it’s a good idea to add these as negative keywords for the campaign.
<br><br>	
Want to know something cool? You can actually see which search queries triggered our ads! Adwords shows these in the Search Terms sub-menu. Here you can see keywords that brought clicks to your site, and add them as keywords, or as negative keywords, depending on how relevant they are to your site. I would recommend adding them as individual words because adding a whole phrase may have an unforeseen impact by creating conflicts with your existing keywords.
 <br><br>
We’ll often be using this report to help us add more negative keywords as we go.
Great job getting this far! Our campaign is almost ready for launch, and for success.
