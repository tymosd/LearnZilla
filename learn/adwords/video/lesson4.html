    <h2 class="text-center">Transcript: How To Adjust Campaign Settings in AdWords</h2>
      <p class="p-transcr">
Welcome back to LearnZilla’s introductory adwords course! In this lesson we’ll get familiar with some of the ad and keyword settings that you can use to improve your campaign’s performance. 
	
<br><br>If you haven’t discovered it already, go ahead and click on your campaign and go to the settings tab. This tab is here, is AdWords is not very intuitive… This tab is there to help us be as granular as possible, and let us make sure that we only get the clicks that we want.
<br><br>Here, you can change the Campaign Name, your search type, and campaign types when we start creating more and more campaigns. Device settings on their own can be a very powerful tool. 
          
<br><br>If our product is a mobile app, then we may only want to advertise to Googlers that are on their phone! We can actually do that if we go into device settings tab. We’re going to accomplish our goal by decreasing what we call a bid adjustment for Computers to -100%. This means that a $10 bid, will become a $0 bid to those using a computer. To increase or decrease bid adjustment on devices, you just click on the bid adjustment column in any of the device rows, enter in a percentage desired, then select increase or decrease, and hit save.
          
<br><br>Remember our keywords? These bid adjustments are applied to a qualifying keyword when a search query is triggered. So when a keywords has a $0 bid, it’ll never enter the auction.
<br><br>In another scenario, we notice that clicks from mobile devices do a little better than Computers and Tablets. In this case, we can always add a bid adjustment of 20% to mobile, so our keyword bids for Computers will always be less than those for mobile… this means that bids for mobile devices will be eligible to go into the keyword auction more of the time. 
<br>To add a 20% bid adjustment, we would select the bid adjustment field in the mobile row, and enter in 20. Easy-peasy.

<br><br>Device settings are very useful, they are actually one of my favorite reports to look at when working with my clients. You can easily improve campaign performance by messing around with these. Most of the time, we’ll notice trends of one device or another doing better, depending on the nature of a business, or in some cases, the quality of a client’s website. For the better-performing devices you can increase the bids, and for those not doing as well, you can always decrease, or leave them as they are. I usually look at the data from the last 30 days or more, and go with a 10-20% bid adjustment for the devices that are doing better, until I’m sure that one device brings in more conversions than another. Keep in mind, that these trends may change from time to time, so be sure to check back into the Devices report often. 
          <br>
Sound good? Let’s go back to our main settings tab.
<br><br>Locations we target can be important too. This tool helps us refine our targeting, and to make sure we don’t get clicks from areas that may find our product irrelevant. This is especially important to businesses like restaurants that focus on local markets. We wouldn’t want to pay for clicks from Seattle if our restaurant is located in New York, right? Unless your restaurant is that good…. Haha then please, do send me an invite.
          
<br><br>Alright, what we can do here is add several geographic targets…. We’ll Hit Edit… and Advanced Search. I love this graphic location interface, I think its incredibly helpful. We can get as granular, or as general as you like. We can go as far as adding the address of our business, and set a target radius around it! Let’s do just that.
          
<br><br>Hit the Radius Targeting tab, enter in our address, which for all intents and purposes just happens to be 123 Chicago Street, Chicago, IL, and set a mile or kilometer radius around it. Default is 20 miles, but I’d like to start with 10, the closer my customers are to my location, the more likely they are to be interested. Look good? Let’s add this. Great. 
          
<br><br>If your campaign is still targeting the whole country, you can always remove those general targets by hitting the Remove button next to them. I’m not sure if targeting clicks nationwide would be profitable if we’re in the restaurant business. So feel free to go back to the Search tab and hit remove to any existing targets you might have. 

<br><br>AdWords will also let us target states, cities, zip codes, as well as exclude them, and I think that exclusions are usually a pretty good idea for any business just to be sure that our ad dollars aren’t going anywhere but the desired geographic targets. I like to go as far as inserting a list of States that are outside of my target location to ensure that we don’t pay for any clicks outside of the target area. You can search for locations in the search bars in the location tab and exclude them there, but to add or exclude a larger list of geographic targets, we can actually use the Bulk Targets tab. You can copy and paste lists of your locations in here and exclude them one by one. I’ll leave this one to up to you.

<br><br>It’s always a good idea to target nearby towns if you think its residents may be interested in your business. Some businesses go as far as stealing clicks from their competition by targeting competitor brand keywords in their location. This is fairly common practice.
<br><br>Alright, after you’ve added your locations, hit Done, and save your location changes!
Just like for devices, you can set bid adjustments for the locations and look at the data about the clicks you get from the surrounding areas. Just go to the locations tab, and make the necessary adjustments as you see the clicks trickle in.
<br><br>Next, you can change the advanced location and language options if you’d like, but the default options are usually applicable to most of my campaigns, so we’ll skip this and Bid strategy for now, as these are some of the more advanced settings that may be worth exploring in the future.

<br><br>Next up down the line of our settings are budgets. The daily budgets are certainly going to be of importance to you if you are working with a pre-determined budget. The dollar amount that you assign in the settings, or in the campaign tab is going to be Google’s daily budget. However! This is a strong however because Google may spend more or less than this budget, depending on search traffic, your bids, and a few other variables. Google say they will only over or under-spend by 20%. And I’d say this is fairly accurate. It’s not often that Google will spend more than 20% of your daily budget, but it still may happen, so keep an eye on how much Google spends…. A consistent 20% overspend of your daily budget can cause you to spend quite a bit more than you intended. In the end though, google claim that AdWords won’t spend more than your daily budget times 30.4… this is the average number of days in a month.
<br><br>If you’re spending less than you’d like, you may want to add more broad match keywords, increase your keyword bids, or look into our next item: Delivery method.

<br><br>The delivery method has to do with how fast google will attempt to spend your daily budget. If you would like your ads to run as soon as possible and as much as possible, first thing in the morning, then you should go with Accelerated Delivery. If you’d like to make sure that your ads show evenly throughout the day, Standard delivery does a good job at this. This is a fairly safe option. But if your campaign is struggling to spend its daily budget, feel free to change this setting to Accelerated.

Very good! We’re almost done with our settings.
<br><br>Next up is your ad schedule. This setting can be useful if your campaign has to end on a certain date, or if you’d like to show your ads at certain points in the day. Let’s hit View Ad Schedule and explore this setting a bit more. Let’s say that our restaurant and is only open in the afternoons. We can choose for our ads to show only after 12 o’clock - noon. 
<br><br>Click on add Ad Schedule, Create Custom Schedule, and select 12pm to 12am, which is midnight. You can even set your hours based on the day of the week. Just keep in mind, that your time zone is based on your gmail account that’s associated with adwords.
<br>Super. Let’s go back to All Settings and discuss our last key item, which is ad rotation. 
          
<br><br>Ad rotation is an adwords feature that will allow Google to automatically show some ads more than others, or show them all evenly. This setting is based on the ad’s Click Through Rate (also called the CTR), but AdWords likely looks at a number of factors. If you’re always creating new ads to see which ones work best, or if you always have new sales offers that you would like to advertise, I’d recommend sticking with Rotate Indefinitely option. This will ensure that all of your ads get shown. Otherwise, you’re relatively safe with Optimize for Clicks. The other two options are not as reliable in terms of driving quality clicks, but feel free to test them out and let us know how they work out for you.
<br><br>
          
We are making strides in getting to know adwords, how things work, and how you can improve campaigns performance. In fact, we are almost ready to launch our campaign. Our next lesson features Sitelinks, which is a great way to help your ads look better than your competition and may make a real difference on whether a potential client clicks on your ad or someone else’s.
