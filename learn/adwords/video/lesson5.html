    <h2 class="text-center">How To Create AdWords Ad Extensions</h2>
      <p class="p-transcr">
<br><br>Welcome back to LearnZilla’s Introductory AdWords course. In our last lesson of setting up our account, we’ll briefly go over how Ad Extensions work and how you can use them to your advantage. 
          
<br><br>Let’s jump right in and take a look at an example. On the left we have an ad with several ad extensions, and right away, you can see there are several distinctions between the two. 
          
Ad extensions are certainly worthy of a lesson of their own, for a number of reasons.
<br><br>They can not only help your ads aesthetically, but they can help direct visitors to pages they’re particularly interested in and help provide valuable conversions like calls from ads.

<br>And there are all sorts of ad extensions out there – location, callout extensions, call extensions, price, review extensions and much more! 
So let’s create a few ad extensions of our own.

<br><br>Among the extensions we saw in our sample ad were Sitelink Extensions…. Right here below the text…. These are a few extra links that show up under your ad and help direct your visitors to different pages on your site that may be more helpful to their search... A bit like a shortcut. More importantly, sitelinks make your ad look much bigger and more professional.
          
<br><br>To start, let’s go to our campaign, and go to the Ad Extensions tab.
Under the View drop-down, select Sitelinks Extensions… and hit add Extension. Extensions’ purpose is to act like a shortcut and direct visitors to areas of the site they’re interested in. Usually, these would follow the structure of the site, so I’ll start with a Contact Us section.
          
<br><br>Hit New Sitelink… give it a title – Contact Us, add the full URL for this section, and add a brief description: Get In Touch With Us To Find Out More About Our Services. Hit save, sand save again.
          
<br><br>What’s great is you can actually use the Ad Preview tool to check out your ads without ever incurring any impressions in your campaign! This is what we saw in the beginning of this lesson! This tool is also very effective in troubleshooting any issues with your ads:<br>
          
It’s bit like a diagnostics tool – you can take a look at what your ads look like once you launch your campaign or figure out why they’re not showing. This tool makes sure that don’t incur any actual views or impressions, so you can search as many times as you want.
          
<br><br>You can access this tool by going to the Tools menu on the very top, then go to Ad preview and Diagnosis. You can see your ads in here once the campaigns are turned on, just be sure to enter in the location that is inside your geographic targets and double check to see if you have budget remaining in the day… Pretty neat!
          
<br><br>Now let’s create one more sitelink that will direct our visitors to the courses page. Let’s head back to our campaigns view, select a campaign, and go to the ad extensions tab. Go ahead and click add new extension, then new sitelink – maybe title this one Our Courses… then we want to insert the URL of the page, and a brief description: View Our Selection Of Free Online Google AdWords Courses.<br>
Aaand save this.
          
<br><br>Now, if you happen to have enough pages on your site, I would recommend adding 2 more sitelinks as Google can show up to 4 of these extensions at a time, and this will make your ads look fantastic. 
We’ll move on to other extensions in the meantime. By the way, if you would like to add these sitelink extensions to another campaign, AdWords makes it super easy. Simply go to the Sitelinks menu in another campaign, then click on the right- or left-facing arrows to move the desired ad extensions around the campaign, and hit save! If they’re on the right side, that means they’re showing, on the left, they are not. Using the same technique, you can actually add different sitelink extensions into each one your ad groups, otherwise these will show up for all of the ad groups.
          <br><br>
          
Great job. I’m also a huge fan of Callout extensions. Unlike Sitelinks, these aren’t shortcuts, neither are they clickable ad extensions, but they provide all sorts of cool bits of information about your business or products just below each ad. Take a look at this one.
<br><br>
 This is extra information that our visitors may find useful. Let’s go ahead and add a few callout extensions to our ads. 
<br><br>We’re going to go back to our View menu, then go to Callout Extensions, ,click Add extension, and New Callout. These extensions are a great way to mention some of the benefits of using your service or product. We can say things like “Free Video Courses”, then maybe “Quick Learning”, and maybe “Practice Questions” for example. Very straightforward. Let’s save these.
          
<br><br>Although My favorite extension is the Call Extension. Call extensions are incredibly useful if you have a locally-based business. These come in so handy if someone is browsing on their phone, they can just hit the Big call button that appears on your ad and they’ll be inquiring about your business in minutes! It’s much more practical than filling out a Contact us or Get a Quote form. These have proven to bring in tonnes more conversions in my experience.
          
<br><br>Feel free to use other ad extensions as well, there can be no harm in these. Google only shows ad extensions they think are going to have a positive impact. Not all of these will show up all of the time, but Google will pick one or two extension types to show with most of your ads. I would say the three extensions we just created, plus a call extension if possible, are a great start.
          
<br><br>With ad extensions in place, you have almost completed account setup. I want to congratulate you on teaching yourself adwords as you have learned a great deal. You may start running your campaigns by hitting the enable button in your campaign view, but be sure to create several conversions and link your Google Analytics account in our next lesson so that you can track your success. By setting up your conversions and linking AdWords to Google analytics, you’ll be able to figure out which of your clicks bring you business, and which ones just bounce out. These are very important aspects of analyzing your Return on Investment, and we’ll set these up quickly and easily in our next lesson. 
          
<br><br>Also, be sure to fine-tune your campaigns at least once per week. Some campaigns take off with huge success, but most will need fine-tuning to make sure they are driving the traffic that you want. AdWords is simply a software, and it may not necessarily know what sort of clicks you are looking to bring in. It is up to you, adwords gurus, to optimize your campaigns and make them profitable…. and there is no campaign out there that cannot be improved. 
          
          <br><br>
Our next few chapters will cover hugely important points about maintaining your account and making it successful. 
<br><br>If you have had even a little bit of luck with the quizzes or if you are already applying the knowledge or thinking about the things we talked about, you are doing an amazing job!
