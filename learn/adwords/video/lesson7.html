    <h2 class="text-center">How To Add Conversions To Google AdWords</h2>
      <p class="p-transcr"> 
Conversions are a exciting part of managing your adwords account – they give you a chance to visualize the impact your campaign is having on your business. <br><br>
First question is – which conversions should we be tracking? Common types of conversions for product-based companies are check-out page visits, contact us page visits,get a quote page, so if a customer is getting a quote this is a clear indicator that they’re interested in your product. For companies that sell a services like LearnZilla, things are a little more tricky so sometimes you have to get creative. It’s good to set some goals like the amount of time a customer spends on the site and number of pages they browse because this shows how interested a visitor is in your service. <br><br>I’d also like to add a Contact Us page visit as a goal, since we will only hear from those interested in LearnZilla. You can also go as far as tracking whether a visitor clicked on a Checkout button, or a Contact Us button. You can do these using your Google Analytics account, and if you havne’t linked your account yet, please watch our lesson on Linking Google Analytics to AdWords.
<br><br> 
Great, lets set up our conversions. Our first move is to go to the Admin menu, and then Goals in the View sub-menu. In the Goals tab, we’ll click Add New Goal.
<br><br>
Custom goals are the best – we’ll usually use these, since they are much easier to set up and they’ll track exactly what we want. Hit Continue and set up the name of your first Goal. Let’s start by tracking visitors that spend 4 or more minutes on your site. 4+ Minutes Spent On Site. This is a Duration type goal, so let’s be sure to hit this box… and hit Continue!
          <br><br>Okay, we have the details window, which we’ll use to give Google the 0 hours, 4 minutes and 0 seconds, which will be our guideline. Go ahead and verify the goal. The Verify button is there to make sure your conversion will work. If there’s any percentage point data in the Verify section, great! Our conversion is working. If not, there may be something wrong with the goal, or the goal is simply too strict to have been met in the last 7 days. This isn’t always always a bad thing, goals are good to set. Let’s make sure everything is correct and hit Save. 
<br><br>That was easy, let’s make some more! We can also set up 4+ Pages Browsed, which is another useful Goal. So let’s create another custom goal. use the Pages/Screens per session and add in a number 4. Let’s verify this. That was easy, right? 
<br><br>One of the most common goals on most websites are visits to particular pages, like Contact Us Page we talked about earlier – this is called a Destination Goal.  In sum, if you direct users to a particular landing page, and they end up on the Contact Us page at one point in time, this will count as a conversion.
<br><br>To create this, let’s go ahead create another custom goal,. Hit Continue… go to Goal Description, name our goal – this will be Contact Us Page Visit, and select Destination type. Continue, and enter in the page URL of this goal. Be sure to not enter the WHOLE url, because Google analytics is already associated with your site and knows its domain, so enter in whatever comes after the first forward slash. In our case, we wouldn’t type in www.learnzilla.com/contactus/index.php , but rather use the link addendum - /contactus/index.php. 
<br><br>If your link changes for any particular URL and is a dynamic URl that changes with each visitor, you can select a different destination goal type – such as Begins With. So a visit to any page with a link that begins with a particular URL structure, will count as a conversion. For example, if I use /learn, then all visits to pages under that URL such as /learn/lesson1 or /learn/adwords/learn will be counted as conversion goals. 
<br><br>Wonderful! We have a basic set of goals that will serve as a bench mark in determining which traffic expresses more interest in our site. To get more granular with our goals, I’d recommend researching Google Tag Manager. 
<br><br>Google Tag Manager will help you easily track which buttons customers click and how they interact with the website. Tag Manager also allows easier implementation of Google Analytics, AdWords, and Facebook tags, so definitely give it a try.
<br>Very good.
<br><br>To make sure you can see your goals in Google Adwords, let’s go back to the AdWords Tools menu and import these conversions….. In your adwords account, hit Tools menu up top, then conversions, and go to the Google Analytics tab. In here you’ll see the list of goals that your linked Google Analytics account is tracking. Check which ones you’d like to see in your AdWords, and hit Import!
<br><br>Great job!. You are now ready to track your conversions! It usually takes a day or so for all the goals from today to be visible in AdWords, so don’t expect to see them right away. Unfortunately, Google Analytics cannot register goals that happened in the past, so give it a few days to register new ones. 
<br><br>This lesson is absolutely mission-critical. Your campaign is now fully set up and is tracking data, conversions, and you can start to see which campaigns are making a splash. Use the conversion data to optimize the keywords that perform the best, and keep an eye on ads and keywords that have high bounce rates. These are the pages that your visitors may not be expecting.
<br><br>One final piece of advice: it’s a good idea to create Call Conversions. You can do this by creating a Call Extension in your adwords account – people who click on your Ad’s Call Extension to call your phone number will show up as a conversion in adwords. It’s an easy ad extensions to set up, and is very effective. 
<br><br>As always, reach out to us with any feedback and we’ll see you back here next time!
